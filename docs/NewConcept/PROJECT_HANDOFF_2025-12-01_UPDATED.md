## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 What We're Building
An internal tool for the investment team to size Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) for colocated Solar + BESS + optional DG projects in the European market.

### 1.2 Core Question Answered
> "Given this solar profile, which size of BESS and DG gives me highest availability with lowest solar wastage in different scenarios while providing maximum load delivery hours or 100% delivery?"

### 1.3 Primary Users
Investment analysts evaluating energy projects

### 1.4 What the Tool Does
- Takes load profile and solar profile as inputs (8760 hourly values)
- Simulates hourly energy dispatch for a full year
- **Iterates through BESS capacities × duration classes × DG sizes**
- **Outputs comparison table with all configurations**
- User decides optimal configuration from results
- Exports results to dashboard and Excel

### 1.5 Current Process Being Replaced
- Excel spreadsheets
- Gut feel / manual estimation

## 5. Source Parameters (Finalized)

### 5.1 Load
- `load_profile`: CSV upload or generated via Load Scenario Builder
- Load Scenario Builder templates: Constant, Day-only, Night-only, Day-peak

### 5.2 Solar
- `solar_profile`: CSV upload (absolute MW, 8760 values)
- `solar_capacity`: MWp (for reporting)

### 5.3 BESS
| Parameter | Unit | Default | Sizing Mode |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `bess_capacity` | MWh | Required | User provides range |
| `bess_charge_power` | MW | Required | **Auto-calculated from duration** |
| `bess_discharge_power` | MW | Required | **Auto-calculated from duration** |
| `bess_efficiency` | % | 85 | User input |
| `bess_min_soc` | % | 10 | User input |
| `bess_max_soc` | % | 90 | User input |
| `bess_initial_soc` | % | 50 | User input |
| `bess_charge_c_rate` | C | 1 | Not used in Sizing Mode |
| `bess_discharge_c_rate` | C | 1 | Not used in Sizing Mode |
| `bess_daily_cycle_limit` | cycles | None | User input |
| `bess_enforce_cycle_limit` | Boolean | False | User input |

**Key Change:** In Sizing Mode, power is derived from capacity and duration class, not user input.

### 5.4 DG
| Parameter | Unit | Default |
|-----------|------|---------|
| `dg_capacity` | MW | Required (range in Sizing Mode) |
| `dg_enabled` | Boolean | False |
| `dg_charges_bess` | Boolean | False |
| `dg_running_mode` | Selection | Load-Following |

---

## 6. Key Technical Decisions (SME Validated)

| # | Decision |
|---|----------|
| 1 | Merit order: Solar → BESS → (DG) → Unserved |
| 2 | Efficiency: sqrt(RTE) applied to both charge and discharge |
| 3 | Cycle counting: Discharge throughput only (matches OEM warranties) |
| 4 | Cycle limit enforce mode: Full disable (charge + discharge) |
| 5 | Cycle limit count mode: Track and warn, no disable |
| 6 | Time step: Hourly (MW = MWh for Δt = 1 hour) |
| 7 | Within-hour: Either charge OR discharge, not both |
| 8 | C-rate: Limits power based on capacity (Fixed Mode only) |
| 9 | Hourly resolution sufficient for CapEx sizing |

---

## 7. Sizing Approach (UPDATED)

### 7.1 Mode Selection
- **Fixed Size Mode:** User provides exact capacity and power; single simulation
- **Sizing Mode:** User provides capacity range; system iterates with duration classes

### 7.2 Sizing Mode Parameters

**User Inputs:**
| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `bess_capacity_min` | MWh range start |
| `bess_capacity_max` | MWh range end |
| `bess_capacity_step` | MWh increment |
| `dg_capacity_min` | MW range start |
| `dg_capacity_max` | MW range end |
| `dg_capacity_step` | MW increment |

**Removed from User Input:**
- ~~`bess_power_min/max/step`~~ — Power is now derived from duration

### 7.3 Duration Classes (System-Generated)

For each capacity value, system automatically tests 7 duration classes:

| Duration | C-Rate | Power Formula |
|----------|--------|---------------|
| 1-hour | 1C | capacity ÷ 1 |
| 2-hour | 0.5C | capacity ÷ 2 |
| 3-hour | 0.33C | capacity ÷ 3 |
| 4-hour | 0.25C | capacity ÷ 4 |
| 6-hour | 0.167C | capacity ÷ 6 |
| 8-hour | 0.125C | capacity ÷ 8 |
| 10-hour | 0.1C | capacity ÷ 10 |

### 7.4 Simulation Matrix

```
total_simulations = capacity_steps × 7 duration_classes × dg_steps
```

Example: 5 capacity values × 7 durations × 5 DG values = 175 simulations

### 7.5 Method
- Single-stage full sweep over all combinations
- Each combination runs full 8760-hour simulation
- Results stored in comparison table
- User decides optimal configuration (no auto-selection)

---

## 8. Output Specification (NEW)

### 8.1 Comparison Table Columns

| Column | Unit | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `capacity` | MWh | BESS energy capacity |
| `duration` | hours | Duration class |
| `power` | MW | Calculated power |
| `dg_size` | MW | DG capacity |
| `delivery_pct` | % | Load delivery percentage |
| `delivery_hours` | hours | Hours with 100% delivery |
| `unserved_mwh` | MWh | Total unserved energy |
| `curtailed_pct` | % | Solar curtailment percentage |
| `curtailed_mwh` | MWh | Total curtailed solar |
| `dg_runtime_hrs` | hours | Total DG running hours |
| `dg_starts` | count | DG start events |
| `bess_cycles` | cycles | Annual BESS cycles |
| `max_daily_cycles` | cycles | Peak daily cycles |
| `is_dominated` | Boolean | Dominated by another config |

### 8.2 Sorting & Filtering

**Default sort:** Delivery % desc, then Curtailed % asc

**Quick filters:**
- "100% Delivery Only"
- "Zero DG"
- "No Curtailment" (< 1%)
- "Hide Dominated"

### 8.3 Dominated Logic

Config A dominates Config B if A is equal or better on all metrics (delivery, curtailment, capacity, DG) and strictly better on at least one.

## 9. Success Metrics

| ID | Metric | Definition |
|----|--------|------------|
| C1 | Hours of ANY Delivery | Hours with any load served |
| C2 | Hours of FULL Delivery | Hours with 100% load served |
| C3 | Hours of GREEN Delivery | Hours with 100% load from Solar + BESS |
| C4 | Unserved Energy | MWh and % not delivered |
| C5 | Solar Curtailment | MWh and % wasted |

**Evaluation:** Binary per hour (100% served = pass, any deficit = fail)

## 10. Technology Stack (Proposed)

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Backend | Python |
| Simulation | NumPy / Pandas |
| UI | Streamlit |
| Export | OpenPyXL |

## 13. Immediate Next Steps

**All 7 dispatch templates are FINALIZED.**
**Sizing iteration logic is COMPLETE.**

**Next Step: Code Implementation**
- Build Python simulation engine for all templates (0-6)
- Build sizing iteration wrapper
- Validate against test cases in specifications
- Create basic Streamlit UI for user interaction

**Implementation Order (Recommended):**
1. Template 0 (Solar + BESS) - Foundation
2. Sizing iteration wrapper with duration classes
3. Template 1 (Green Priority) - Add DG basics
4. Templates 4, 5, 6 (SoC-triggered) - Share common patterns
5. Templates 2, 3 (Time-window based) - More complex time logic
6. Output comparison table and filtering

**Code Architecture Considerations:**
- Common BESS dispatch logic can be shared across templates
- Sizing wrapper calls simulation engine for each combo
- Assist Mode / Recovery Mode patterns reusable
- dg_mode state machine consistent across templates 4, 5, 6
- Output table generation separate from simulation

---

## 14. Key Constraints

1. **No code generation until user approves**
2. **User has Python experience, will use Claude Code in VSCode**
3. **Investment analysts are end users (need simple UI)**
4. **MVP limitation: Tool sizes for Year 1 only**
5. **User decides optimal config from comparison table (no auto-selection)**

- System generates 7 duration classes automatically
- Full comparison table output
- User decides optimal config (no auto-selection)
