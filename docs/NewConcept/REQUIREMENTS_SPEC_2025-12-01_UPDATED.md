### 3.3 BESS Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Unit | Required? | Default | Sizing Mode | MVP |
|-----------|-------------|------|-----------|---------|-------------|-----|
| `bess_capacity` | Total energy capacity | MWh | Yes | - | User provides range | ✓ |
| `bess_charge_power` | Max charge rate | MW | Fixed Mode only | - | Auto-calculated | ✓ |
| `bess_discharge_power` | Max discharge rate | MW | Fixed Mode only | - | Auto-calculated | ✓ |
| `bess_efficiency` | Round-trip efficiency | % | Optional | 85 | User input | ✓ |
| `bess_min_soc` | Minimum SoC floor | % | Optional | 10 | User input | ✓ |
| `bess_max_soc` | Maximum SoC ceiling | % | Optional | 90 | User input | ✓ |
| `bess_initial_soc` | Starting SoC | % | Optional | 50 | User input | ✓ |
| `bess_charge_c_rate` | Max charge C-rate | C | Optional | 1 | Not used (duration sets effective C-rate) | ✓ |
| `bess_discharge_c_rate` | Max discharge C-rate | C | Optional | 1 | Not used (duration sets effective C-rate) | ✓ |
| `bess_daily_cycle_limit` | Max cycles per day | cycles | Optional | None | User input | ✓ |
| `bess_enforce_cycle_limit` | Enforce limit? | Boolean | Optional | False | User input | ✓ |

**Sizing Mode vs Fixed Mode:**
- **Fixed Mode:** User provides exact capacity and power values; tool runs single simulation
- **Sizing Mode:** User provides capacity range; power is auto-calculated from duration classes

**Power Calculation in Sizing Mode:**
```
bess_charge_power = bess_capacity ÷ duration_hours
bess_discharge_power = bess_capacity ÷ duration_hours
```

**Assumption:** Charge power = Discharge power (symmetric) in Sizing Mode.

**C-Rate Note:**
- In Sizing Mode, C-rate is implicitly set by duration class (e.g., 2-hour = 0.5C)
- The `bess_charge_c_rate` and `bess_discharge_c_rate` parameters are not used in Sizing Mode
- In Fixed Mode, C-rate constraints still apply

**Cycle Calculation Method:**
- Cycles = Total energy discharged ÷ Usable capacity
- Only discharge throughput is counted (industry standard per OEM warranties)
- Cycle count resets daily at midnight

**Daily Cycle Limit Behavior:**

| Mode | `bess_enforce_cycle_limit` | Behavior |
|------|---------------------------|----------|
| **Count-Only** | No | Cycles are tracked and reported. BESS continues operating. Output includes "Days exceeding cycle limit" as a warning metric. |
| **Enforce** | Yes | When daily cycle limit is reached, BESS is fully disabled (no charge, no discharge) for remainder of that day. Resets at midnight. |

**CRITICAL: DG-BESS Independence (D91):**
- When BESS is disabled due to cycle limit, **DG continues to operate normally** based on its own triggers.
- DG serves load directly; excess DG is curtailed (cannot charge disabled BESS).
- BESS cannot assist DG when disabled (remaining deficit becomes unserved).
- This ensures DG protects load even when BESS is warranty-constrained.

**Time Step Assumption:**
- Simulation uses hourly time steps (Δt = 1 hour)
- MW values are treated as MWh for each hour
- Within each hour, either charging OR discharging occurs (not both)

**Duration Calculation (Output):**
- Duration (hours) = bess_capacity ÷ bess_discharge_power
- This is calculated/reported as part of output

**Parked for Future Versions:**
- Self-discharge rate (% per hour)
- Calendar degradation
- Cycle-based degradation
- Degradation buffer / State of Health factor (for 10-year sizing)
- Temperature effects
- BESS unit combinations (1×100 MW vs 4×25 MW)
- Charge and discharge within same hour (requires sub-hourly resolution)

### 3.4 DG Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Unit | Required? | Default | MVP |
|-----------|-------------|------|-----------|---------|-----|
| `dg_capacity` | Rated power output | MW | Yes (if DG enabled) | - | ✓ |
| `dg_enabled` | Is DG included in topology? | Yes/No | Yes | No | ✓ |
| `dg_charges_bess` | Can DG charge BESS when running? | Yes/No | Optional | No | ✓ |
| `dg_running_mode` | How DG outputs power | Selection | Optional | Load-Following | ✓ |

**DG Running Modes:**
1. **Full Capacity:** DG outputs 100% of rated capacity when ON
2. **Load-Following:** DG outputs only what is needed (up to capacity)

**DG Charges BESS Behavior:**
- Only applies when DG is already running to serve load
- DG does NOT turn on proactively to charge BESS
- Excess DG output (in Full Capacity mode) or additional headroom (in Load-Following mode) can charge BESS

**Behavior Matrix:**

| dg_running_mode | dg_charges_bess | Behavior |
|-----------------|-----------------|----------|
| Full Capacity | No | DG outputs 100% when ON. Excess beyond load is wasted. |
| Full Capacity | Yes | DG outputs 100% when ON. Excess charges BESS, remainder wasted. |
| Load-Following | No | DG outputs only what load needs (up to capacity). |
| Load-Following | Yes | DG outputs load need + BESS charging need (up to capacity). |

**Parked for Future Versions:**
- `dg_min_load` - Minimum stable operating point (%)
- `dg_fuel_type` - Diesel or Gas
- `dg_fuel_consumption` - Fuel rate (L/MWh)
- `dg_min_run_time` - Minimum run time once started
- `dg_max_daily_runtime` - Maximum hours per day
- `dg_start_cost` - Cost per start event
- `dg_ramp_rate` - Ramp up/down rate
- Multiple DG units

|-----------|-------------|------|-------|-----|
| `simulation_hours` | Total simulation length | hours | 8760 (fixed) | ✓ |
| `time_step` | Resolution | hours | 1 (fixed) | ✓ |

**Parked for Future Versions:**
- Partial year simulations
- Sub-hourly resolution (15-min, 5-min)
- Time zone handling
- Daylight saving adjustments

---

### 3.6 Sizing Parameters

**Mode Selection:**
User chooses between:
1. **Fixed Size Mode:** User provides exact BESS capacity, power, and DG size; tool runs single simulation
2. **Sizing Mode:** User provides capacity and DG ranges; tool iterates across all duration classes

**Sizing Mode Inputs:**

| Parameter | Description | Unit | Required |
|-----------|-------------|------|----------|
| `bess_capacity_min` | Start of capacity range | MWh | Yes |
| `bess_capacity_max` | End of capacity range | MWh | Yes |
| `bess_capacity_step` | Capacity increment | MWh | Yes |
| `dg_capacity_min` | Start of DG range | MW | Yes (if DG enabled) |
| `dg_capacity_max` | End of DG range | MW | Yes (if DG enabled) |
| `dg_capacity_step` | DG increment | MW | Yes (if DG enabled) |

**Note:** Power range inputs (`bess_power_min/max/step`) are NOT used in Sizing Mode. Power is derived from duration classes.

---

### 3.7 Sizing Iteration Logic (NEW)

#### 3.7.1 Duration Classes (System-Generated)

The system automatically tests 7 standard duration classes for each capacity value:

| Duration | C-Rate | Power Formula | Market Term |
|----------|--------|---------------|-------------|
| 1-hour | 1C | capacity ÷ 1 | Short-duration, frequency response |
| 2-hour | 0.5C | capacity ÷ 2 | Most common utility-scale |
| 3-hour | 0.33C | capacity ÷ 3 | Transitional |
| 4-hour | 0.25C | capacity ÷ 4 | Growing market, capacity contracts |
| 6-hour | 0.167C | capacity ÷ 6 | Long-duration emerging |
| 8-hour | 0.125C | capacity ÷ 8 | Long-duration storage |
| 10-hour | 0.1C | capacity ÷ 10 | Extended duration |

**Why Multiple Durations Matter:**
- Same capacity with different power ratings performs differently
- Lower power (longer duration) = cheaper but may curtail solar (can't absorb spikes)
- Higher power (shorter duration) = more expensive but handles variable loads better
- Tool shows all options; user decides based on project economics

#### 3.7.2 Simulation Matrix

For each combination of:
- Each capacity value in range
- Each duration class (7 values)
- Each DG size in range

System runs a full 8760-hour simulation and records all metrics.

**Example:**

User inputs:
- Capacity: 50-150 MWh, step 50 MWh → 3 values (50, 100, 150)
- DG: 0-10 MW, step 5 MW → 3 values (0, 5, 10)
- Duration classes: 7 (system-generated)

Total simulations: 3 × 7 × 3 = **63 simulations**

Each simulation = 8,760 hourly calculations
Total calculations: 63 × 8,760 = **551,880 calculations**

Estimated runtime: **< 5 seconds** on modern hardware

#### 3.7.3 Simulation Count Formula

```
capacity_steps = ((bess_capacity_max - bess_capacity_min) ÷ bess_capacity_step) + 1
dg_steps = ((dg_capacity_max - dg_capacity_min) ÷ dg_capacity_step) + 1
duration_classes = 7

total_simulations = capacity_steps × duration_classes × dg_steps
total_calculations = total_simulations × 8760
```

#### 3.7.4 Validation Rules

| Rule | Action |

| `bess_capacity_min` ≤ 0 | ERROR: Capacity must be positive |
| `bess_capacity_max` < `bess_capacity_min` | ERROR: Max must be ≥ min |

### 8.2 Sorting & Filtering (UI)

**Default sort:** Delivery % descending, then Curtailed % ascending

**Quick filters:**

| Filter | Logic |
|--------|-------|
| "100% Delivery" | Show only rows where `delivery_pct` = 100% |
| "Zero DG" | Show only rows where `dg_size` = 0 |
| "No Curtailment" | Show only rows where `curtailed_pct` < 1% |
| "Hide Dominated" | Hide rows where `is_dominated` = True |

**Column sorting:** User can click any column header to sort ascending/descending

### 8.3 Dominated Configuration Logic

A configuration is **dominated** if another configuration exists that is:
- Equal or better on `delivery_pct`
- Equal or better on `curtailed_pct` (lower is better)
- Equal or smaller on `capacity`
- Equal or smaller on `dg_size`
- **Strictly better** on at least one of the above metrics

Dominated rows are flagged with `is_dominated = True`.

**UI Default:** Dominated rows shown but can be hidden via filter.
